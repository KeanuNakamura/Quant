# Hermes - Democratized Quant Trading

Hermes is on a mission to make sophisticated, AI-powered trading accessible, understandable, and trustworthy for everyoneâ€”not just the financial elite. We believe everyone should have the ability to harness quantitative trading, no complex jargon or secret formulas required.

## Architecture

- **Frontend**: React + Tailwind (clean UI, onboarding form, dashboard with charts)
- **Backend**: FastAPI (Python) for quant engine + REST API endpoints
- **Quant libraries**: pandas, numpy, yfinance (for free market data in MVP)
- **Deployment**: Docker + docker-compose for local dev

## Features

- User onboarding form to collect investment preferences
- Recommendation Engine API that generates portfolio allocations
- Dashboard with visualizations of portfolio performance
- Risk metrics and investment rationale
